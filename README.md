# Weather-App
  In this project a minimalist weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city. It features a clean and intuitive interface with an input field for city names, fetching live data through the OpenWeatherMap API. 
  The display includes key details like temperature, weather description, and an icon representing current conditions. I focused on responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices. Error handling is implemented for invalid inputs, providing a user-friendly interface. The app prioritizes simplicity, offering a quick and efficient way for users to access essential weather information. Overall, this project showcases my proficiency in frontend development, API integration, and creating functional, user-centered applications.
